scratchblocks but scratchjr

## Syntax

Blocks are created from a text input.

* To add a block, enter its name (e.g. forward).
* To create a script, enter the names of many blocks in sequence (e.g. flag right forever).
* To create several scripts, enter scripts on new lines (e.g. entering "click msg" on the first line and then "onmsg say" on the next line will create those two scripts individually)
* To pass an input to a block (experimental, only partially working), enter the name of a block which takes an input followed by the input (e.g. jump 5, say hi there, say "double quotes don't work as intended yet but will eventually")
